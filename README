You must create a personal access token at https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications

Save the token to a hidden file called ".DO_TOKEN"


Note that ssh keys are added for user 'core' rather than 'root' as is typical.


Since most return calls from DO are large; if you are going to want to read them, you will probably be using `jq`

##jq recipes
```bash
#list the id, given name, and ips associated with all droplets
./list_all.sh |  jq ' .droplets[] | {name:.name, id:.id, ips: [.networks.v4[].ip_address] }'
```
